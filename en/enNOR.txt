<<take joshua coleman , for example .>
<<when his family sold their chicago-based telecom company for $ 400m in 2004 , they didn’t run out and buy something extravagant .>
<<instead , they began seeking advice on ways to save their newfound riches and help them grow .>

<<many spaniards who’ve made the move find themselves surprised by the mix of modernity , opportunity and comforts of home in countries like peru , chile and brazil .>
<<angel lopez , 26 , is one of them .>
<<the alicante native arrived in lima , peru , in march , 2012 , and went from an unpaid internship at spain’s former canal 9 tv station to a job as the head of media for a large educational company in peru two years later .>

<< “ what makes a book collectible is another matter , ” he said .>
<<it will usually be desirable to collectors because of its subject matter say , chess or ornithology ; its author or illustrator , charles dickens or e h shepard ; when and where it was printed ; or something special about the physical book itself like its binding or its previous ownership .>
<<in fact , sometimes later editions of rare books are “ more desirable because they have additional information or illustrations , ” haley said .>

<<berlin is a city that never stands still .>
<<glassworts as a group have had a long and interesting career outside of food additives .>
<<the name refers to several different groups of tidal plants that look a bit like tiny pickles stacked end-to-end .>
<<one type of glasswort played a prominent role in the glass industry in england as a source for sodium oxide , or soda .>
<<just on their own , many glassworts are edible , and you might see them on the menu as sea beans or samphire .>
<<some of those proteins are soluble in water , which is why , in addition to meat , these sausages always have crushed ice as an ingredient ( and it's ice , not water , because if the mixture gets too warm , the fat droplets find their way to each other and make big , unattractive islands of fat in the sausage ) .>
<<some of the proteins are only soluble in the presence of salt , however .>
<<that means that salt is not just a flavouring – it's a key part of ensuring that the hot dog holds together .>
<<according to property website rightmove , house price growth in the south east now outstrips london , as buyers are forced out of the increasingly unaffordable capital .>
<<it said the latest price data across england and wales indicates owners asking 2 .>
<<6 % more for homes in september compared to august .>
<<rightmove said the average asking price was now £ 271 , 669 .>
<<it said the increase was the slowest rise for this time of the year since 2008 .>
<<but it said prices are set to continue to surge in areas outside london for the coming few years , according to rightmove .>
<<analysis by rightmove and oxford economics forecasts that the south east will see prices increase by 37 % over the coming five-year period , ahead of london at 33 % and 30 % across the nation .>
<<areas with good london-bound train links would benefit from those priced out of the capital .>

<<the history begins with the first picture ever taken of a building , which likely happened in the mid-1800s when photography started to take off .>
<<redstone’s book starts in the 21st century , and the corresponding exhibit at the barbican in london ( called constructing worlds : photography and architecture in the modern age ) starts in the 1930s .>
<<from early days photographers used architecture as a subject partly because of the immobile qualities that make it easy to focus on .>
<<then they were looking at wider social issues , using architecture as a symbol of who we are as a society .>
<<that conscientiousness ( at least , in the context of the constructing worlds exhibit ) starts with berenice abbott’s images from changing new york , which she took for the depression-era , government-backed federal art project .>
<<her shots during those years document the newly minted skyscrapers and high rise buildings that were quickly turning new york city into a new metropolis .>
<<on the other side of the country , in the deep south , walker evans photographed the architectural artifacts of rural , usually poor , communities .>
<<buildings like tenant farmer homes , roadside stands , and town churches feature prominently .>
<<he also took them during the depression , and was actually commissioned by a new deal agency to take some of these to help promote the government’s efforts at helping rural families .>
<<what he did instead was documentary work : his images are an unveiled look at american life and tradition in a time of economic catastrophe .>
<<it finally happened : snapchat will now have ads .>
<<pinterest is also experimenting with advertising , as is instagram .>
<<all three of these companies are in the enviable position of running wildly popular online platforms , but also in the less enviable position of not having a great , obvious way to make money off of them .>
<< ads seem like the most direct plan , but there’s a problem , a problem summed up by one man .>

<<labour’s mansion tax will have to be paid immediately by anyone earning over £ 42 , 000 , ed balls announced today .>
<<owners of properties worth over £ 2m who earn less than £ 42 , 000 will still have to pay the tax but will be able to defer payment until they transfer ownership of the property .>
<<plans to defer payment have been compared to a “ death tax ” .>
<<the shadow chancellor made the announcement in an effort to persuade doubters that the policy will not be unfair on “ asset-rich , cash-poor ” homeowners .>

<<his currency as a presidential contender will surely vanish if he cannot win a second term as the governor of wisconsin .>
<<beside her , priyo sleeps the sleep of the sinless .>
<<his early-morning snore has a three-toned sound to it – a snarly growl in the inhalation , then a hissing during part of the exhalation , completed by a final high-pitched insecty whine .>
<<she hears the scouring sound of a broom sluicing out with water some drain or courtyard .>
<<someone is cleaning his teeth in the bathroom of a neighboring house – there is the usual accompaniment of loud hawking , coughing and a brief , one-note retch .>
<<a juddering car goes down basanta bose road with the unmistakable sound of every loose vibrating component about to come off – a taxi .>

<<this is how this world begins every day ; noise is the way it signals that it is alive , indomitable .>
<<the sparrows send up a chinkless wall of manic cheeping .>
<<the doleful remonstrations of the pigeons , shuffling about on windowsills , sometimes tumble over into an aggressive chorus ; they have the same merciless presence .>
<<the sound of water loops like a liquid thread through the other sounds ; someone is beating their washing against the stone or concrete perimeter around a running tap .>
<<the clatter of metal buckets ; uninterrupted cawing of crows ; wrangling stray dogs ; a distant conch-shell being blown three times in the prayer room of a house nearby … here , up on the first floor of 22/6 basanta bose road , all sounds converge as in an amphitheater .>
<<had she , her husband and their daughter , baishakhi , lived on the top floor , where her parents-in-law and their favorite son , their eldest , adinath , and his family have their quarters , it would have been so much less noisy , she knows .>
<<and away from the onslaught of mosquitoes , which would never have been able to ascend to the third floor .>
<<and , of course , more distant and safer from the troubles in the streets , bombings and murders , the terrifying stuff she hears about , that have started erupting in the city .>
<<who can say that their street will not be the scene of such action ? from the thought of that one minor instance of preferential treatment of dada to the real cause of all the rankling is a negligible distance .>
<<dada , her elder brother-in-law , had been groomed to enter the family business , charu paper & sons ( pvt .>
<<ltd ) , from his school days and had obediently followed the path set out for him by his father , a trajectory as natural as the cycle of seasons .>
<<if family stories and reminiscences are to be believed , her husband , priyo , however , had never shown any interest in the business , despite receiving the same training and indoctrination that his older brother had .>
<<if this had once caused ructions and displeasure , they are long vanished now , or almost vanished , for it is so obvious and accepted that adinath is going to inherit the greater share of the family wealth in all its forms – business , money , house – that it is , like the air one breathes , not noticed , not remarked upon .>

<<we enjoy the emotions that russell brand stirs in us , he’s exciting , he’s articulate and he has sex with lots of women .>
<<on the contrary , politicians are dry and generally inarticulate , although they do seem hell bent on fucking the lot of us .>
